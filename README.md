notes: 
  Your mission:
    create a working dashboard which visualizes 
      real time 
      historical values 
    of a hypothetical set of equipment in the field. 

    The equipment publishes its data every 1.3 seconds.

  BTW: historical means "charting" the last 30 minutes of data,
  ~and realtime means displaying it prominently. 
  (So one could scan the page and see the current value).

  Live examples are linked in the drawer to the left.
